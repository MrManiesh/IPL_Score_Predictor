# IPL Score Predictor
This project is a Machine Learning based score predictor for IPL matches. It predicts the final score of an innings based on the current score, wickets and overs, as well as other variables such as runs scored in the last 5 overs and wickets lost in the last 5 overs.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the model was obtained from Kaggle - Indian Premier League (Cricket).

# Models
Three models were used for predicting the score:

- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network

# Usage
To use the model, simply input the following variables:

- Batting Team
- Bowling Team
- Runs
- Wickets
- Overs
- Runs in last 5 overs
- Wickets in last 5 overs
And the model will predict the final score of the innings.

# Streamlit App
A Streamlit app was also created for easier usage of the model. The app takes user inputs for the above mentioned variables and displays the predicted score.
